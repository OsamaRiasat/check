Dear Sir/Madam:
I am writing to apply for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, in which I am very interested. A degree from one of the most prestigious, highest and most prestigious universities is my opportunity to enrich my knowledge and abundance of expertise. With this letter of encouragement, I would like to say that I will be enrolling in this undergraduate program.
My interest in programming and computer began at the time in my college when I first came in contact with the computer code used to create a scientific calculator. I really enjoyed coding it, and I intended to start working on my own small projects, building other apps. I have followed online tutorials to solve the problems I encountered along the way. It was really interesting and empowering to create something new, from scratch.
In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my commitment to new experiences, improve my skills and deepen my understanding of the dynamic world of IT, and I am confident that studying BS in Computer science can help my development as an IT Specialist in the best possible way.

Thank you so much for processing my request.Sincerely,
Your Name
